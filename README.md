🚀 My Coding Playground
-------------------------------------------------

Welcome to my little corner of code experiments!
This is where I upload all the projects I build as I learn, explore, and challenge myself.

Think of it like a digital workshop — full of small creations, big ideas, and fun side quests.

------- What's Inside -------

🎮 Games (like Pong, Snake, etc.)

⚙️ Utilities (small scripts and tools)

🌱 Learning Projects (practice and exercises)

🚧 Work in Progress (experiments that may grow bigger)

------- Tech Stack -------

Python

Turtle (for graphics)
Qt Framework (For GUIs)

Other libraries depending on the project

------- Goals -------

Keep practicing by building fun projects

Improve clean code structure (classes, OOP, modules)

Turn small experiments into polished apps

------- Contributions -------

This is mostly my learning space, but if you spot improvements or cool ideas, feel free to open an issue or PR!

✨ Thanks for stopping by! Watch this repo grow as I keep experimenting and learning 🚀
